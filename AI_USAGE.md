# AI Usage Disclosure
This document outlines the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the development of the Parametric Timer VHDL project.

## AI Model Used
- Model: Google Gemini (Flash & Pro versions)
- Purpose: Code generation for CI/CD pipeline architecture and VUnit integration troubleshooting.

## Contributions by Gemini
1. Testbench Development (tb_timer.vhd)
Since this was my first time using VUnit, Gemini helped bridge the gap between standard VHDL testbenches and the vunit_lib requirements (e.g., test_runner_setup and check_equal procedures). The AI assisted in implementing the logic to convert natural generics into time types to ensure compatibility with GHDL.

2. CI/CD Pipeline (ci.yml)
Gemini provided the YAML structure for GitHub Actions. The AI was instrumental in resolving specific environment issues, such as the GHDL "404 Unexpected HTTP response" and the Ubuntu versioning conflicts (switching from ubuntu-latest to ubuntu-22.04).

## Verification
The code generated by Gemini was not used blindly. I followed a verification process:

- VHDL Code Verification
1. Every version of tb_timer.vhd was compiled and run locally using GHDL.
2. I analyzed the simulation errors (e.g., delta cycle timing issues or type mismatches) and refined the code until the timing checks were 100% accurate.
3. I cross-referenced the generated VUnit procedures with the official vunit.github.io documentation to ensure best practices were followed.

- CI/CD Verification
1. The .yml file was tested through consecutive git push actions.
2. I monitored the GitHub Actions logs for every fail.
